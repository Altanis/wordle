# WORDLE 2.0

While Wordle by itself may be fun, it becomes more intriguing when additional features are added. As such, I've taken the liberty to work on an open-sourced extension of Wordle.
Currently, the source code is unfinished and only has the basic Wordle functions. In the coming days, updates will be pushed and extended features will function.

Progress:
- [x] Basic Wordle Functions
    - [x] Create serversided functions (initializing a game, guessing words, getting results).
    - [x] Create clientsided functions (adding elements on DOM and making them functional).
    - [x] Statistics, to see how well you've fared in your wordles.
- [ ] Options Menu
    - [ ] Create toggleable dark mode.
    - [ ] Add hint system. 
- [ ] Multiplayer Battles
    - To be elaborated on further in the near future.

***Progress is variable and may change at any moment.***
